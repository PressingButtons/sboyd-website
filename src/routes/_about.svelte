    </header>
    <p>I'm Steven Boyd, a Chicago native branching out into Web development. I love getting into the zone with code and learning how to reiterate and improve my works</p>
    <p>I will admit, I'm still new to this whole thing, despite that I find the plunge refreshing. I consider the craft an artform and I get chills when I see great examples of it</p>
    <p>My personal workings can be found on either <a href="https://github.com/PressingButtons/" target="_blank">github</a> or my <a href="https://pressingbuttons.itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io</a> page. </p>
    <p>Previously I worked Mainframe IT for 5 years before eventual changing trades to focus on web developement and game design.</p>
    <p>The experience has proven to be both enlightnening and humbling. It's fair to say that given my role(s), there was fairly any technical overlap between the two fields.</p>
    <p>Despite this, I have a sincere love for the craft, love for coding that has have me perserve through this journey and I plan to keep at it.</p>
