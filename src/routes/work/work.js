            Second commission, that's currently in production. 
            The project would have me tackle creating a shopify shop to supply ecommerce from the start.
            There wasn't any references that I could use from the start other than other websites in the same vein. 
            As such, combined with learning the shopify system itself, this has proven to be an ambitious projecti.

            `
            Though somewhat similar, shopify still proves to be a different beast compared to Wordpress and PHP.
            To reduce cost while still managing to provide extended features of the site, I took to task to learn
            about shopify-liquid as well as the structure of shopify themes to provide custom template blocks.

            `
            The project is still underwayb but please check back in the future for updates.

            This was first website commision, certainly an eye openeing experience.
            The client already had a website using squarespace that I was able to use as a reference;
            however, the client wished for something that broke the mold of a standard wysiwyg solution.

            After plenty of research for what other artist websites are doing, I compiled a few mock 
            sketches of what could be the overlook of the website. From there, the client would enhance 
            or completely redirect the design structure I was going for. I found this to be a great
            learning expereince as rejection certainly helps shape the final design as much as positive feedback.

            `
            With an agreed upon designed, I continued forth creating a custom child theme for the website.
            The project took about a year for fruiton, but left with a satisfactory result for the client.
            I still work occassionaly on the site to spruce up bits here and there for the site.

            This project was just something I wanted to do for fun and growth. 
            The goal was to create a light-weight editor program which would lend me insight into application development.
            I studied clip studio to see deconstruct aspects such as UI elements and interactions.

            The project certainly gave me a largar appreciations to those who build applications, esepcially those in charge
            of creating UI elements and interactivity. I still have a mind to go back and reconstruct this project as 
            I've learned plenty since 2021. I would most likely use svelte to encapsulate elements for instance into components. 
            Regardless, I'm still quite fond/proud of this attempt.
